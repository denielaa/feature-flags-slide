## Why use Feature Flags?

- Release anytime, Deployment != Release
- Progressive Delivery
- User Segmentation/Targeting
- Kill Switch, Minimize Risk
- Blue/Green Deployment

## Implementing a feature flag

- Homemade solution
- Use a SaaS provider (LaunchDarkly, *Unleash*, etc)
- Ideally should be low latency, cached, have an audit trail

## Trade-offs

- Increase complexity in the code
  - Reduced visibility, readability, and maintainability
- Technical debts
- Performance impact
- More code to *(maintain and test)*
- Combinatorial explosion

</L.Column>

<L.Column>

## Best Practices

- Include FFs as part of the *User Story planning*, *acceptance criteria*, and *Definition of Done*
- Standardize the naming convention
  - Clear and descriptive names
  - Consistent naming
  - Consistent prefix and suffix: `featureXxxEnabled`

</L.Column>

---

<L.Column>

## Best Practices (cont'd)

- Document the FFs with its purpose and parts of the application that are affected
- Creation/_Expiration_ dates
- Have a process to remove FFs
- _Never reuse FFs_, keep their surface area limited
- Collect and analyze FFs metrics on a regular basis
